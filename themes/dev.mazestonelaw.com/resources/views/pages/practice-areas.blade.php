			     	<h2 class="text-center">Personal Injury</h2><p class="justify">If you or a loved one has sustained any type of injury as a result of the carless or
				        negligent actions of another, it is important to seek the help of an experienced attorney. At the Maze &amp;
						      Stone, we can examine the facts of your case, help determine what actions need to be taken, and work
						      	         endlessly to get you the compensation you deserve. Many injuries can leave people with pain and
								 	       suffering, medical bills, wage loss and other undue hardships. Frequently, people are hesitant to file a
									       		      claim or lawsuit, because they are reluctant to sue fellow members of their community or local
											      	        businesses. However, the overwhelming majority of settlements or awards are paid by big insurance
														        companies. Maze &amp; Stone puts litigation and investigation experience to work holding insurance
																       companies and big corporations accountable when accidents or negligence cause people to suffer.</p>

																           <h2 class="text-center">Criminal Defense</h2>
																	           <p class="justify">At Maze &amp; Stone, we realize that good people make mistakes. An arrest and
																		          subsequent criminal charges can be one of the most stressful and trying times of one’s life. The
																			  	         attorneys at Maze &amp; Stone are committed to minimizing this stress and helping people get on with their
																					 	       lives. There are steps that need to be taken following your arrest to help raise the best possible defense
																						       	          in your case. Maze &amp; Stone has the knowledge and experience to identify those steps, and tailor our
																								         defense to each client’s needs.</p>

																									     <h2 class="text-center">Workers Compensation</h2>
																									     	     <p class="justify">Workplace injuries can take a serious toll on you and your family and cause
																										     	    undue hardship on you physically, emotionally, and financially. If you have been injured at work, do not
																											    	      let your employer talk you out of filing a claim. Oftentimes, employers will make promises to injured
																												      	      workers that they do not intend to keep, in an attempt to dissuade them from filing a claim. You could
																													      	          be missing out on compensation that you are entitled to. Do not try to go it alone. The process of filing a
																															         claim can be confusing and stressful. Maze &amp; Stone has the knowledge and expertise to guide you
																																           through the process. We will work aggressively and tirelessly to get you the compensation you deserve.</p>
